# pass.it
A unified, online, paperless hall pass system for students.

## Project Purpose
pass.it will probably never be picked up by any large organizations, but it provides me with a cool opportunity to practice node.js and Angular in a real website.

## Technologies Used
pass.it will utalize node.js and Angular JS. Node.js packages used will include Express.js and others. HTML and CSS3 are used for web design.

## Required Elements
 - Teacher login
 - Class database with student names, schedules, and picture (possibly)
 - Fuzzy student search algorithm
 - Email server to send out passes
 - Current teacher classes built based on current time and bell schedule

## Possible Technologies
 - List.js for fuzzy search: http://www.listjs.com/examples/fuzzy-search
